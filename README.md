# Practice
1.	Write a Java program to get the character (Unicode code point) at the given index within the String.
2.	Write a Java program to compare two strings lexicographically, ignoring case differences. Two strings are lexicographically equal if they are the same length and contain the same characters in the same positions.
3.	Write a Java program to convert all the characters in a string to uppercase.
4.	There is SQL Data Source connection string (structure {host}\{instance name},{ip}; Example: localhost\MyTest,8768). Create regex which can handle input Data Source connection strings and take from it port, host name and instance name information.
